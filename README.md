## Briefs for each stage

### 🔴 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 🟡 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 🟢 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 🔵 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 🟣 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*This sketch represents an unconventional passing of time through a random flavoured scoop of ice cream being added onto an ice cream cone each second. The title is a play on words because the phrase would mean asking for a second scoop of ice cream on a cone when this is adding a scoop of ice cream to the cone every second. I have imposed a limit so that when the ice cream tower approaches the top of the canvas, it will start over. I wanted to show how more of something can be accumulated through the passing of time until it reaches a limit and then must be rebuilt from the bottom again. The reason for putting this in a repeating cycle is because of how I view time.  Time is an endless loop while everything else is finite; things will rise, then fall and have to rebuild, but time will keep going. You can only have so much of something before its goes or you do, either one, but then the cycle will start again with someone or something new. The random scoop colours represent the unpredictability of circumstances through time because you never know what's going to happen in the next second, minute or year. I have used a dark grey background to allow the ice cream scoops to pop but also not look too harsh as they would against a pure black background.*

  *I wanted to keep with the idea that things can grow over time, fall,  and be re-built. Time is an endless loop but we can choose what we do with it so I added three buttons the user can choose from that add a scoop to the tower. - I also changed the space between the scoops of ice cream so it would take less scoops to reach the top of the canvas. A forth button resets the background and means the user can start stacking the scoops again. I wanted to add a classic ‘game over’ sequence to the sketch, so when the scoops reach the top of the canvas, three blocks of colour move down the screen along with text saying “start again”.
I wanted this sketch to be a bit playful while still having an underlying theme of the passing of time from the previous brief.*

Indeed, as time goes by, things do change. The interaction between two completely different things is particularly appealing. Especially, when a change in one thing often triggers a corresponding change in another, which is often quite interesting. In my project, I included a song, so please turn on the speakers and immerse yourself fully while browsing. As the melody of the song flows, the changes in the song's spectrum on the interface are cleverly represented by the number of ice cream balls stacked in ice cream cones. These ice cream balls, of various flavors and arranged in an orderly manner, visually represent the intensity of different frequencies in the song's spectrum through their numbers. In the process of completing this project, I received assistance from ChatGPT. I asked ChatGPT for advice on how to load music in p5.js and how to process the distributed spectrum obtained from the music. I used the spectrum data at each moment to draw ice cream cones of corresponding heights on the canvas, thus demonstrating that time can be recorded through the changes of tangible objects.

*For stage IV of this task, I began with noon0v0's project because I wanted my game to have background music. So, I deleted most of their original code (a visualisation of the song) and left the button that played the music. I changed the music file to a (YouTube to MP3) bard core version of Lana Del Ray's "Summertime Sadness" to match the DnD vibe I was going for. The game is simple:*

> You begin with a note asking for help, which you accept or deny.
> 
> Then, you have to choose between "left" and "right" six times
> 
> There are two ways of losing the game:
 >> Getting lost
 >> Invading the privacy of a demon
>
> If you make all six correct choices, you win

*I wanted this game to feel like a long journey with high risks and an extremely low and unfulfilling end price, as this is the setup for my favourite type of jokes (longer than needed and not that funny)
I also kept the "Game Over" sequence from a previous stage I worked on that involved the "A Second Scoop" corpse but changed it to look more like icecream dripping down the screen.
Finally, if you win the game, you don't have to refresh the page, instead, you can press a button to play again*

*I decided to go with a creative interpretation of entity. When I read entity, I thought of an inescapable, terrifying creature. To do this, I used a similar structure than the game I created on stage IV, but shorter and with no possible wins. I made it so that it looked like the demon was the one talking to you, and that the music in the background was scarier, and that glitch sounds played when you pressed "accept" or "decline" and either of the next two options as well. I also made squares appear in front of the demonic image to represent the user's vision going blurry and glitching out.*
*It does seem to have an issue when you refresh the page. Some paths that previously worked may not work anymore. I tried fixing this issue in multiple ways but nothing (except fro removing the squares appearing on top of the image) seem to make it work consistently. So if it doesn't work, I guess the forest demon is REALLY mad at you ^-^*
